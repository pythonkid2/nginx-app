# Problem Statement

### Objective
Setup a CI/CD pipeline using tools of your choice (or preferably the mentioned tools) to achieve the following goals:
1. **Deploy on Code Push**: The pipeline should deploy a simple web application to a server whenever code is pushed to a repository.
2. **Accessibility**: The deployed web application should be accessible via any web browser.
3. **Scalability**: The deployment should be scalable. When the load increases, the number of servers should automatically scale up and down while ensuring that newly launched servers have the updated code.

### Additional Requirements
1. The setup should be done using **AWS**, **Jenkins**, and **CodeDeploy**.
2. **Jenkins** should not be installed on the same server as the one hosting the deployed application.

### Tools
- **Jenkins**
- **Git/Bitbucket**
- **AWS EC2**
- **AWS CodeDeploy**
